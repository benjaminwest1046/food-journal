#DietTracker

##About
The goal of this project was to create a CRUD app using only the MEN stack. (MEAN but with no Angular). This application allows users to input a meal that they had on a given day. This will help those on a diet to monitor what they had on a daily basis. 
Additionally, there is a section of the application where users can type in a food and get back common types of that food with a calorie counter. For example, you type in Chicken and get back common foods with chicken like "Chicken - Grilled" with the amount of calories. The results that come back are from the Nutritionix API and the data is retrieved via an AJAX call.
